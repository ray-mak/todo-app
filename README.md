<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This is a todo app I created using a design from Frontend Mentor.</p>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

<h1>My Process</h1>
<p>As always, I start with the HTML and CSS. I code each section for desktop and then for mobile. For example, I'll design the header elements, and then style it for mobile screens, and then move on to the main element. After the styling is done and optimized for mobile, I move on to the Javascript. I start with simpler functions like deleting tasks and filtering tasks. Then I move towards more complicated functions like inputting, storing and dragging/dropping tasks.</p>

<h2>Built With</h2>
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Vanilla JS

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>I learned how to implement dark mode using CSS variables and Javascript localstorage to store dark mode preferences.</p>
<p>I also learned how to use localStorage to save new and completed tasks. I also learned how to implement a drag and drop function for elements.</p>

<h2>Continued Development</h2>
<p>This is a nice intro to building todo apps. However, I would like to improve on the design by adding some more features, like a date feature, or an edit feature. As it stands, there's no way to edit existing tasks. Secondly, since I designed the app to replicate FrontEnd Mentor design, the app pre-loads with tasks. I would like to create code that will remember the positions of the tasks using localStorage.</p>
